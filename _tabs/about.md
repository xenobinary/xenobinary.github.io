I am an experienced, **self-taught** programmer, software engineer, project manager, quant, consultant, and **defeated enterpeneur**—not formally trained in computer science—and also a somewhat nitpicky older Chinese man.

I am currently pursuing a **Master's degree in Computer Science** in [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/). Since I no longer have the memory retention of my youth, I document complex concepts here for organization and as a memory aid.

*Thank you for reading*.
